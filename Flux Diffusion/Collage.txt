Vintage magazine collage featuring high contrast and high grain textures, designed in a mixed-media illustration style. Inspired by Richard Hamilton and Joe Webb, the artwork depicts two men lounging in a park on a sunny day, wearing loincloths and having a playful picnic. The composition includes bold, cut-out elements, surreal juxtapositions, and a retro color palette. The background shows abstract, hand-cut shapes and layered textures blending into the vibrant park scenery.
